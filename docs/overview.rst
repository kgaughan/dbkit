Overview

.. note::
   Like dbkit itself, this documentation is a work in progress. Unlike
   dbkit, it is nowhere near complete yet. Bear with me.


Introduction
============

*dbkit* is intended to be used in circumstances where it is impractical
or overkill to use an ORM such as `SQLObject`_ or `SQLAlchemy`_, but it
would be useful to at least abstract away some of the pain involved in
dealing with the database.

Features:

- Rather than passing around database connections, statements are executed
  within a database `context`_, thus helping to decouple modules that
  interface with the database from the database itself and its connection
  details.
- Database contexts contain references to the exceptions exposed by the
  database driver, thus decoupling exception handling from the database
  driver.
- Easier to use transaction handling.
- Easier iteration over resultsets.
- Connection pooling. In addition, any code using pooled connections has
  no need to know connection pooling is in place.
- Query logging.

Non-aims:

-  Abstraction of SQL statements. The idea is to get rid of the more
   annoying but necessary boilerplate code involved in dealing with
   `DB-API 2`_ drivers, not to totally abstract away SQL itself.

Comparison with straight DB-API 2 code
======================================

Need a "Hello, World!" example? Here's how you'd set up a connection context,
query a database table, and print out its contents with `dbkit`::

    from dbkit import connect, query
    from contextlib import closing
    import sqlite3

    with connect(sqlite3, 'counters.db') as ctx, closing(ctx):
        for counter, value in query('SELECT counter, value FROM counters'):
            print(f"{counter}: {value}")

And here's how you'd so it with a DB-API 2 (using *just* :pep:`249`, no
driver-specific extensions)::

    import sqlite3
    from contextlib import closing

    with closing(sqlite3.connect('counters.db')) as conn:
        with closing(conn.cursor()) as cur:
            cur.execute('SELECT counter, value FROM counters')
            while True:
                row = cur.fetchone()
                if row is None:
                    break
                print("%s: %d" % row)


Download
========

The latest *development* version can be found in the `dbkit` Git repository::

    git clone https://github.com/kgaughan/dbkit

The project has yet to be submitted to PyPI, but I'm hoping to do that as soon
as I'm happy with the documentation. To build a source package for installation
and subsequently install it, do::

   python setup.py sdist
   pip install dist/dbkit-0.2.5.tar.gz

Alternatively, you can install it directly, bypassing package creation::

   python setup.py install


Requirements
============

`dbkit` will work with Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.3+ without issue. It appears to
have some minor issues with PyPy, but it ought to work fine. Since 0.2.3,
it is no longer compatible with Python 2.5.

`dbkit` has no dependencies other than requiring a database driver and six
to allow Python 2 and Python 3 support.
