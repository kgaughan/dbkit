**dbkit** is a library that abstracts away at least part of the pain
involved in dealing with `DB-API 2`_ compatible database drivers.

Overview
========

*dbkit* is intended to be used in circumstances where it is impractical
or overkill to use an ORM such as `SQLObject`_ or `SQLAlchemy`_, but it
would be useful to at least abstract away some of the pain involved in
dealing with the database.

Features:

- Rather than passing around database connections, statements are executed
  within a database `context`_, thus helping to decouple modules that
  interface with the database from the database itself and its connection
  details.
- Database contexts contain references to the exceptions exposed by the
  database driver, thus decoupling exception handling from the database
  driver.
- Easier to use transaction handling.
- Easier iteration over resultsets.
- Connection pooling. In addition, any code using pooled connections has
  no need to know connection pooling is in place.
- Query logging.

Non-aims:

-  Abstraction of SQL statements. The idea is to get rid of the more
   annoying but necessary boilerplate code involved in dealing with
   `DB-API 2`_ drivers, not to totally abstract away SQL itself.
